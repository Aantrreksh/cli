# Managing classic infrastructure SSH keys and SSL certificates (ibmcloud sl security)
{: #sl-manage-security-keys}

SSH keys allow access to a device without using a password from corresponding clients for each public key that is implemented on the device. By adding an SSH key to a device, the device that was provided with the SSH key accesses the device for the corresponding key without the use of a password.
